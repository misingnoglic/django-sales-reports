This is a Django application I made for Scott Nixon at Happy Herbivore. Their website (www.happyherbivore.com) is a place where he and his wife sell vegan cookbooks and weekly meal plans.

This application takes the sales data from the DPD API (which keeps track of their sales) and creates it into a chart so that they can easily see which weeks are the most popular for sales.

The application is fairly specialized to their application (such as how it finds the week of the meal plan), but those quirks are commented.
